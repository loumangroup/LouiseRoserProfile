      <div class="SectionParagraph">
        <p>I am a 23 year old Australian woman. I graduated from Year 12 in 2016, and began a Certificate III in Cabinet Making in 2020. I will be completing the Bachelor of Information Technology part time, aiming for completion by 2028. I enjoy creative pursuits in my free time, such as painting and writing, and I've just taken up roller skating as a fun way to get more exercise.</p>

        <h1>INTEREST IN IT</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="SectionParagraph">
        <p>I haven't completed any formal education in IT, or explored any particular interest in the branch as a whole, until I realised most of the things I have enjoyed in the past have been reliant on IT. I remember being a teenager and spending hours tirelessly editing the html of my tumblr page, to display my current interests and information in the most trendy, aesthetically pleasing way. Of course I am a huge fan of video games as well, and was always intrigued by the overlap of technology and creativity that has to happen for a brilliant video game to be created.</p>

        <p>Choosing to study Information Technology at RMIT for education was a simple decision for me. The institution has an great reputation, and the university itself also has many tools to help students with their studies. The accessibility of the online courses and the support from OUA and RMIT online is also a factor that made the decision incredibly easy.</p>

        <p>With the help of RMIT, I hope to broaden my mind in relation to the field of IT and be able to conceptualise new ways in which technology can assist me in any future endeavours, whether they be creative or more scientific. I aim to learn and understand the workings of different programming languages, and become more inventive and creative with the ways i can implement them in the future.</p>

        <h1>IDEAL JOB </h1>
      </div>

      <div class="SectionParagraph">
        <p>With my current knowledge of the world of IT, and where I could fit into it, my dream role is as a Front End Developer, where I can implement my skills in programming hand in hand with my interest in design and creativity.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57387519?type=standard#sol=c082ac3f2c29c1814c2c290ca7eb426808b04728"target="_blank">Seek Listing</a></P>
        <h2>POSITION</h2>

        <p>Just Digital People are looking for a Front End Developer to work on projects for a variety of different clients. The listed examples include several intriguing projects that I believe can have a positive impact on the world, such as an application for livestock trading, effectively removing middlemen from the process to allow farmers to keep more of the profits. Other examples of projects relate to matters of public health and safety, like bushfire planning and heart disease prevention.</p>
        <p>These wide range of applications are what piqued my interest in this particular position,  and I would be excited to work closely with the clients and other developers in the team to create helpful and meaningful programs. Benefits of the position include a high salary and flexible working conditions and hours.</p>

        <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>

        <p>The position, like many Front End positions, requires proficiency in JavaScript languages, as well as TypeScript. The ideal candidate will also be a flexible and adaptable worker, with efficient methodology to work across several varying projects concurrently. Due to the company working closely with their clients, a strong ability to communicate is also required, to keep the project running smoothly.</p>
        <h2>MY SKILLS</h2>

        <p>I believe I have the drive and passion for a position like this, and already have the necessary skills in communication and interactions with clients, as I have been working with clients frequently in my current job. I also have the ability to present feedback to other members of my team, and project managers, which facilitates a healthy team environment.</P>

        <p>I pride myself on efficiency and flexibility when it comes to work, and though it is something that doesn't always come easy in certain environments, its something I am always willing to work on, to improve my minds ability to multi-task and assess the best pathway for completion. Through completing several courses at time throughout my studies at RMIT, I will work on those skills to ensure I have the capability to work on several things at once.</p>

        <p>The skills I would need to learn would be TypeScript and the JavaScript frameworks, like React, Angular or Vue. I believe with dedication to my courses at RMIT i will be able to learn the basics of languages and frameworks such as these, and apply those principles to whatever framework I need, to learn it quickly and with an eye for detail and efficiency.</p>

          <div class="results">
            <p>In accordance with the Myers-Briggs framework, I am a "logician", which means I am introverted, analytical and creatively minded. Unsurprisingly, this is not the answer I received the last time I took the test (when I was 14). Now almost ten years later I find myself actually identifying with these results, as a more fully formed person, confident in her own thoughts and abilities.</p>

          <div class="results">
            <p>I am a visual learner, although I believe all the so-called "learning styles" can be interchanged based on the situation, I do find that as a creative person with a penchant for pattern recognition and a fondness for graphs and other ways of arranging data and insights, visuals are the more comfortable and efficient way for me to learn.</p>

          <div class="results">
            <p>The DISC Assessment categorises a person based on four traits, Dominance, Influence, Stability and Cautiousness. I am equal parts dominant/cautious. This means I am focused on details and results, I am firm and precise, driven and analytical.</p>
          </div>

         <h2>RESULTS</h2>
          <p>Being a C/D INTP is a concern when it comes to group work. According to many of the results for these personality types, I can be commandeering, unfeeling and rather detached. Although none of these are traits you would want to hear about a prospective team mate I believe they can be useful when kept in check. Logicians also enjoy brainstorming and hearing many conflicting ideas, and I believe I can utilise these skills to help my team make firm decisions and clear pathways for our prospective projects, by focusing on the details of the tasks.</p>
          <p>A good team has a range of personalities, everyone being able to share their strengths, and help with each other’s weaknesses. I believe when forming a team I need to look for people who have strong ideas, can have insightful discussions, are driven and determined, and are not going to be too passive within the process.</p>

          <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="ArticleBody">
          <p>PopSwap is a concept for an app for iOS and Android. It is intended to be used as an open marketplace for trading of second hand clothes and accessories, with no exchange of money, only goods. The app will allow everyday people to find others to trade with, to continue changing their wardrobes without adding to mass clothing wastage or contributing to fast fashion, all while saving money and rehoming unused items.</p>

          <h1>MOTIVATION</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="ArticleBody">
          <p>Even the least fashionable among us will have noticed the changing landscape of the fashion industry. The increased use of internet based fast-fashion brands has caused the trend cycle to accelerate, with online fashion giant Shein adding an average of 2,000 new products per day in 2021(Chen, 2021). On average, Australians acquire 27 kilograms of new clothing every year, with 23 kilograms of their old clothing ending up in a landfill (Clothing Textiles Waste, 2021).</p>

          <p>The industry is a sustainability nightmare, but the hope comes from the increased demand for second hand clothing, with Australian marketplace gumtree citing that clothing, shoes and accessories as their most popular items to sell, an increase of over 500% in sales since 2011(Gumtree Second Hand Economy Report, 2019).
          With the creation of PopSwap, Australians can trade their unwanted clothing, satisfying their need for new items without contributing to the overproduction of new pieces, and preventing their old pieces from ending up in landfills.</p>

          <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="ArticleBody">
          <p>The app will be free for cross platform download on iOS or Android. Users can list the items they have grown out of or grown tired of on the app. Each item will be graded into a categorical value system, and a type of item, i.e. dress, pants, necklace.  They will be able to give the item a brief description describing its quality and condition.</p>

          <p>The value system takes away exact dollar value from the listing that other users will see, so as to deter from too much value comparison, encouraging a more flexible marketplace. For example, an item the owner values at $45 might be listed as Category C, while an item valued at $80 might be Category E. This way users will have a rough indication of how much something is worth, and can inform how much they want to trade for a particular item, without making it necessary for trades to be exactly equal in value.</p>

          <p>The trades themselves will be the onus of the traders, and the map function of the app will show roughly how far a specific item is from you. This way, people who only want to trade locally can find people in their area to trade with. Trades will be encouraged to be done in public places, but as any open marketplace, it is up to the discretion of the traders. A possibility for further development could be nation wide trading, but the burden of postage would be on the traders, and would require possible success of a local version of the app.</p>

              <li>  User2 can select the item/s in User1's profile they would be willing to trade for.</li>

        <div class="ArticleBody">
          <p>To incentivise honest trades and behaviour on the app, each user will have a star rating on their profile, which will be crowdsourced from those they have traded with before. Take the example with User1 and User2. When they log the trade as completed, they will be prompted to rate each other. Ratings should take into consideration that the quality of the item matches its description and the conduct of the user at the swap.</p>

        <h1>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="ArticleBody">
        <p>The app would be cross platform, but requiring a fairly large amount of processing power, to display photos and messages. The app would be built using an existing framework that allows the builder to utilise functions such as push notifications, profile creation and access to databases. BuildFire JS is an option for this procedure. It is an open source app builder which allows you to use html or JavaScript on top of its existing platforms, to minimise the amount of functions that need to be built from scratch.</p>
        <p>The app will need the ability to store and display photos, profiles, messages and trade history, so a large server would be necessary. There may be the possibility to put a cap on how many items a user can have listed, to cut down on stored data.</p>

      <div class="ArticleHead">
        <h1>SKILLS REQUIRED</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="ArticleBody">
        <p>The app will need to be incredibly user friendly, so a good understanding is UX Design is necessary. The interface needs to be accessible and aesthetically pleasing, so Front End Development is important to the process. To build the app on an existing open source platform will reduce the overall knowledge needed by the builders, but to implement all features of the app properly, the builder will need fairly comprehensive knowledge of the framework, and the web based language (i.e. JavaScript) they will use to build the remaining functions, and customise the app to be a unique interface.</p>
        <p>A cloud based server will need to be reserved, most likely through a third party company, so there will be operating costs to keep the app viable.</p>

        <h1>OUTCOME</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="ArticleBody">
        <p>A successful implementation of this project will create a space for people to be more conscious of their wardrobe, their consumption and environmental impact in regards to fashion. The app will allow people to continue to update or change their style without needing to spend money or increase the number of items they already own, and deter people from buying from fast fashion websites. The app will encourage people to alter their views on consumption, and this change in attitudes can slowly but surely affect large companies, forcing movement in the industry landscape. Ideally, the app will slow the acceleration of waste in the fashion industry, and motivate people to be more mindful of their personal impact.</p>
