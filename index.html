        <p>I am a 23 year old Australian woman. I graduated from Year 12 in 2016, and began a Certificate III in Cabinet Making in 2020. I will be completing the Bachelor of Information Technology part time, aiming for completion by 2028. I enjoy creative pursuits in my free time, such as painting and writing, and I've just taken up roller skating as a fun way to get more exercise.</P>

        <h1>INTEREST IN IT</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="SectionParagraph">
        <p>I haven't completed any formal education in IT, or explored any particular interest in the branch as a whole, until I realised most of the things I have enjoyed in the past have been reliant on IT. I remember being a teenager and spending hours tirelessly editing the html of my tumblr page, to display my current interests and information in the most trendy, aesthetically pleasing way. Of course I am a huge fan of video games as well, and was always intrigued by the overlap of technology and creativity that has to happen for a brilliant video game to be created.</p>

        <p>Choosing to study Information Technology at RMIT for education was a simple decision for me. The institution has an great reputation, and the university itself also has many tools to help students with their studies. The accessibility of the online courses and the support from OUA and RMIT online is also a factor that made the decision incredibly easy.</P>

        <p>With the help of RMIT, I hope to broaden my mind in relation to the field of IT and be able to conceptualise new ways in which technology can assist me in any future endeavours, whether they be creative or more scientific. I aim to learn and understand the workings of different programming languages, and become more inventive and creative with the ways i can implement them in the future.</P>

        <h1>IDEAL JOB </h1>
      </div>

      <div class="SectionParagraph">
        <p>With my current knowledge of the world of IT, and where I could fit into it, my dream role is as a Front End Developer, where I can implement my skills in programming hand in hand with my interest in design and creativity.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57387519?type=standard#sol=c082ac3f2c29c1814c2c290ca7eb426808b04728"target="_blank">Seek Listing</a></P>
        <h2>POSITION</h2>

        <p>Just Digital People are looking for a Front End Developer to work on projects for a variety of different clients. The listed examples include several intriguing projects that I believe can have a positive impact on the world, such as an application for livestock trading, effectively removing middlemen from the process to allow farmers to keep more of the profits. Other examples of projects relate to matters of public health and safety, like bushfire planning and heart disease prevention.</P>
        <p>These wide range of applications are what piqued my interest in this particular position,  and I would be excited to work closely with the clients and other developers in the team to create helpful and meaningful programs. Benefits of the position include a high salary and flexible working conditions and hours.</P>

        <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>

        <p>The position, like many Front End positions, requires proficiency in JavaScript languages, as well as TypeScript. The ideal candidate will also be a flexible and adaptable worker, with efficient methodology to work across several varying projects concurrently. Due to the company working closely with their clients, a strong ability to communicate is also required, to keep the project running smoothly.</p>
        <h2>MY SKILLS</h2>

        <p>I believe I have the drive and passion for a position like this, and already have the necessary skills in communication and interactions with clients, as I have been working with clients frequently in my current job. I also have the ability to present feedback to other members of my team, and project managers, which facilitates a healthy team environment.</P>

        <p>I pride myself on efficiency and flexibility when it comes to work, and though it is something that doesn't always come easy in certain environments, its something I am always willing to work on, to improve my minds ability to multi-task and assess the best pathway for completion. Through completing several courses at time throughout my studies at RMIT, I will work on those skills to ensure I have the capability to work on several things at once.</p>

        <p>The skills I would need to learn would be TypeScript and the JavaScript frameworks, like React, Angular or Vue. I believe with dedication to my courses at RMIT i will be able to learn the basics of languages and frameworks such as these, and apply those principles to whatever framework I need, to learn it quickly and with an eye for detail and efficiency.</p>

        <h1>PERSONALITY TESTS </h1>

            <h2>MYERS BRIGGS</h2>
            <h3>INTP - LOGICIAN<h3>
              <h4><a href="https://www.16personalities.com"target="_blank">16personalities</a></h4>
          </div>

          <div class="results">
            <p>In accordance with the Myers-Briggs framework, I am a "logician", which means I am introverted, analytical and creatively minded. Unsurprisingly, this is not the answer I received the last time I took the test (when I was 14). Now almost ten years later I find myself actually identifying with these results, as a more fully formed person, confident in her own thoughts and abilities.</P>

            <h2>LEARNING STYLES</h2>

            <h4><a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment"target="_blank">Learning Assessment</a></h4>
          </div>

          <div class="results">
            <p>I am a visual learner, although I believe all the so-called "learning styles" can be interchanged based on the situation, I do find that as a creative person with a penchant for pattern recognition and a fondness for graphs and other ways of arranging data and insights, visuals are the more comfortable and efficient way for me to learn.</p>

          <div class="Test">
            <h2>DISC ASSESSMENT</h2>
            <h3>D/C - C/D<h3>
            <h4><a href="https://discpersonalitytesting.com/free-disc-test"target="_blank">DISC Test</a></h4>
          </div>

          <div class="results">
            <p>The DISC Assessment categorises a person based on four traits, Dominance, Influence, Stability and Cautiousness. I am equal parts dominant/cautious. This means I am focused on details and results, I am firm and precise, driven and analytical.</p>
          </div>

         <h2>RESULTS</h2>
          <p>Being a C/D INTP is a concern when it comes to group work. According to many of the results for these personality types, I can be commandeering, unfeeling and rather detached. Although none of these are traits you would want to hear about a prospective team mate I believe they can be useful when kept in check. Logicians also enjoy brainstorming and hearing many conflicting ideas, and I believe I can utilise these skills to help my team make firm decisions and clear pathways for our prospective projects, by focusing on the details of the tasks.</p>
          <p>A good team has a range of personalities, everyone being able to share their strengths, and help with each otherâ€™s weaknesses. I believe when forming a team I need to look for people who have strong ideas, can have insightful discussions, are driven and determined, and are not going to be too passive within the process.</p>
